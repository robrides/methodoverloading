## Overload vs Override

Overriding and Overloading are two very important concepts in Java. They are _confusing_ for Java 'novice' programmers. This post illustrates their differences by using two simple examples.

First, let's review method basics.

* A method declaration has these parts.
  * Access modifier (optional)
  * Specifier (optional)
  * Return type
  * Method name
  * Parenthesis
  * List of parameters in parenthesis (optional)
  * Exception declaration (optional)
  * Body 
 
Which of these make up the method signature?
 
The name of the method, along with its list of parameter datatypes, is termed the method's _signature_.
